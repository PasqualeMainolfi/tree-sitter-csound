# **Vectorial Random Signal Generators**

These opcodes generate vectors of random numbers to be stored in tables. They generate a sort of 'vectorial band-limited noise'. All these opcodes work at k-rate. 

Vectorial random signal generators: [vrandh](../opcodes/vrandh.md) and [vrandi](../opcodes/vrandi.md).

Cellular automata vectors can be generated using: [vcella](../opcodes/vcella.md).
