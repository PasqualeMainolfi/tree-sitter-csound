# **Operations Between a Vectorial and a Scalar Signal**

These opcodes perform numeric operations between a vectorial control signal (hosted inside a function table), and a scalar signal. Result is a new vector that overrides old values of the table. There are k-rate and i-rate versions of the opcodes.

All these operators are designed to be used together with other opcodes that operate with vectorial signals such as [vcella](../opcodes/vcella.md), [adsynt](../opcodes/adsynt.md), [adsynt2](../opcodes/adsynt2.md), etc.

Operations Between a Vectorial and a Scalar Signal:

* [vadd](../opcodes/vadd.md)
* [vmult](../opcodes/vmult.md)
* [vpow](../opcodes/vpow.md)
* [vexp](../opcodes/vexp.md)
* [vadd_i](../opcodes/vadd_i.md)
* [vmult_i](../opcodes/vmult_i.md)
* [vpow_i](../opcodes/vpow_i.md)
* [vexp_i](../opcodes/vexp_i.md)
