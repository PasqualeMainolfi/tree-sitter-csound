# **Operations Between two Vectorial Signals**

These opcodes perform operations between two vectors, that is, each element of the first vector is processed with the corresponding element of the other vector.  The result is a new vector that overrides the old values of the source vector.

Operations Between two  Vectorial Signals:

* [vaddv](../opcodes/vaddv.md)
* [vsubv](../opcodes/vsubv.md)
* [vmultv](../opcodes/vmultv.md)
* [vdivv](../opcodes/vdivv.md)
* [vpowv](../opcodes/vpowv.md)
* [vexpv](../opcodes/vexpv.md)
* [vcopy](../opcodes/vcopy.md)
* [vmap](../opcodes/vmap.md)
* [vaddv_i](../opcodes/vaddv_i.md)
* [vsubv_i](../opcodes/vsubv_i.md)
* [vmultv_i](../opcodes/vmultv_i.md)
* [vdivv_i](../opcodes/vdivv_i.md)
* [vpowv_i](../opcodes/vpowv_i.md)
* [vexpv_i](../opcodes/vexpv_i.md)
* [vcopy_i](../opcodes/vcopy_i.md)

All these operators are designed to be used together with other opcodes that operate with vectorial signals such as [vcella](../opcodes/vcella.md), [adsynt](../opcodes/adsynt.md), [adsynt2](../opcodes/adsynt2.md), etc.
