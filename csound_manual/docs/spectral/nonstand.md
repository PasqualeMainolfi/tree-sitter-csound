# **Non-standard Spectral Processing**

These units generate and process non-standard signal data types, such as down-sampled time-domain control signals and audio signals, and their frequency-domain (spectral) representations. The data types (_d_-, _w_-) are self-defining, and the contents are not processable by any other Csound units.

The opcodes for non-standard spectral processing are:

* [specaddm](../opcodes/specaddm.md)
* [specdiff](../opcodes/specdiff.md)
* [specdisp](../opcodes/specdisp.md)
* [specfilt](../opcodes/specfilt.md)
* [spechist](../opcodes/spechist.md)
* [specptrk](../opcodes/specptrk.md)
* [specscal](../opcodes/specscal.md)
* [specsum](../opcodes/specsum.md)
* [spectrum](../opcodes/spectrum.md)
