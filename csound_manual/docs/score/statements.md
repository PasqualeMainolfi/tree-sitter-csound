# **Score Statements**

The statements used in scores are:

* [a](../scoregens/a.md) - Advance score time by a specified amount
* [b](../scoregens/b.md) - Resets the clock
* [B](../scoregens/capB.md) - Accumulate clock adjustment
* [C](../scoregens/C.md) - Toggles carry facility
* [d](../scoregens/d.md) - Deletes an infinite instrument
* [e](../scoregens/e.md) - Marks the end of the last section of the score
* [f](../scoregens/f.md) - Causes a [GEN subroutine](genroutines.md) to place values in a stored function table
* [i](../scoregens/i.md) - Makes an instrument active at a specific time and for a certain duration
* [m](../scoregens/m.md) - Sets a named mark in the score
* [n](../scoregens/n.md) - Repeats a section
* [q](../scoregens/q.md) - Used to quiet an instrument
* [r](../scoregens/r.md) - Starts a repeated section
* [s](../scoregens/s.md) - Marks the end of a section
* [t](../scoregens/t.md) - Sets the tempo
* [v](../scoregens/v.md) - Provides for locally variable time warping of score events
* [x](../scoregens/x.md) - Skip the rest of the current section
* [y](../scoregens/y.md) - Set seed for random numbers, either from p1 or, if omitted, the clock
* [{](../scoregens/leftbrace.md) - Begins a non-sectional, nestable loop.
* [}](../scoregens/rightbrace.md) - Ends a non-sectional, nestable loop.

Comments are denoted by semicolon (;), double slash (//) or the character c and last until a newline. Also C-style comments /\* ... \*/ are allowed.
