# **File Conversion (HET_IMPORT, HET_EXPORT, PVLOOK, PV_EXPORT, PV_IMPORT, SDIF2AD, SRC_CONV)**

The following utilities exist for file conversion:

* [HET_EXPORT](het_export.md): Exports a .het (produced by [HETRO](hetro.md)) to a comma separated text file.
* [HET_IMPORT](het_import.md): Generates a .het (in the format produced by [HETRO](hetro.md)) from a comma separated text file for usage with the [adsyn](../opcodes/adsyn.md) generator.
* [PVLOOK](pvlook.md): View formatted text output of STFT analysis files.
* [PV_EXPORT](pv_export.md): Converts a file generated by [PVANAL](pvanal.md) to a text file.
* [PV_IMPORT](pv_import.md): Converts a text file (in the format generated by [PV_EXPORT](pv_export.md)) to a [PVANAL](pvanal.md) format file to be used with the [pvoc](../opcodes/pvoc.md) opcode.
* [SDIF2AD](sdif2ad.md): Converts SDIF files to files usable by adsynt.
* [SRC_CONV](src_conv.md): Converts the sample rate of an audio file.
