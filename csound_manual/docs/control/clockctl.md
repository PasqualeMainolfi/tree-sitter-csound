# **Clock Control**

The opcodes to start and stop internal clocks are:

* [clockoff](../opcodes/clockoff.md)
* [clockon](../opcodes/clockon.md)

These clocks count CPU time. There are 32 independent clocks available. You can use the opcode [readclock](../opcodes/readclock.md) to read current values of a clock. See [Time Reading](timeread.md) for other timing opcodes.
