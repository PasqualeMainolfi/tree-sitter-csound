# **Amplitude Converters**

Opcodes to convert between different amplitude measurements are:

* [ampdb](../opcodes/ampdb.md)
* [ampdbfs](../opcodes/ampdbfs.md)
* [db](../opcodes/db.md)
* [dbamp](../opcodes/dbamp.md)
* [dbfsamp](../opcodes/dbfsamp.md)

Use [rms](../opcodes/rms.md) to find the rms value of a signal. See also [0dbfs](../opcodes/0dbfs.md) for another way to handle amplitudes in csound.
