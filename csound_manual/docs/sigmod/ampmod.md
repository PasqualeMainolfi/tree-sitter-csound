# **Amplitude Modifiers and Dynamic processing**

The opcodes that modify amplitude are:

* [balance](../opcodes/balance.md)
* [balance2](../opcodes/balance2.md)
* [compress](../opcodes/compress.md)
* [compress2](../opcodes/compress2.md)
* [clip](../opcodes/clip.md)
* [dam](../opcodes/dam.md)
* [gain](../opcodes/gain.md)

The opcode [0dbfs](../opcodes/0dbfs.md) facilitates the use of amplitude by removing the need to use of explicit sample values.
