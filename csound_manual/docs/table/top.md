# **Function Table Control**

Refer to the [f score statement](../scoregens/f.md), [ftgen](../opcodes/ftgen.md), [ftgentmp](../opcodes/ftgentmp.md), [ftgenonce](../opcodes/ftgenonce.md) and the [GEN Routines](../score/genroutines.md) section for information on creating tables.

Tables can be removed from memory using the [ftfree](../opcodes/ftfree.md) opcode.

Tables by default, require a size which is a power of two. However tables with any size can be generated by specifying the size as a negative number (see [f score statement](../scoregens/f.md)).

> :memo: **Note**
>
> Not all opcodes accept tables whose size is not a power of two, as this may be a requirement for internal processing.

For information on table access, consult the section [Table Access](../siggen/tableacc.md).

Tables for use with the [loscilx](../opcodes/loscilx.md) opcode can be loaded using [sndload](../opcodes/sndload.md).
